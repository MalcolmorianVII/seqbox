## Database notes

* sample_source_identifier needs to be unique within a group
    * confirm this with the PI, Brigitte says that many of the older TB studies 
    and some of the COM studies don't go through PreLink.
* if you add an existing sample_source_identifier associated with a different 
project then that sample_source_identifier will be associated
with that project.
* projects (and hence samples, sample sources, etc) can't be 
shared between groups
* projects is an attribute of sample_source because it's the 
sample source which is the primary thing enrolled in the project,
not the sample itself
* we have raw sequencing class because what if we want to re-basecall the
same sequencing run?
* raw_sequencing_batch name has to be unique across all projects/groups
* How to handle multiple picks from same sample?
    * Multiple picks should be added as new samples, related to the same
    sample source of course. Ideally, the sample identifier will make it
    easy to see that they're multiple picks. E.g. BMD671-1, BMD671-2.
* currently assuming that whenever you have new raw sequencing, 
you are also adding a new readset as well.
* if you add a new readset with the same raw sequencing 
(identified by the extraction information), then only the new readset
is added (and it is linked to the same raw_sequencing record)
