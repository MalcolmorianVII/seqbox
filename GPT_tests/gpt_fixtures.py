# In these tests, we are testing two different scenarios - one where there is an existing relationship between the sample source and project(s), and one where there is a new relationship. We use a mocked version of the query_projects function to simulate the behavior of the database. We also use fixtures to set up a sample source, sample source info, projects, and a database for testing.

# The first test (test_check_sample_source_associated_with_project_existing_relationship) tests that the function associates the project(s) in the input file with the sample source when there is an existing relationship between them. We set up the mock for the query_projects function to return a project that already exists in the database. We then call the function with the sample source and sample source info, and check that the project(s) in the input file are associated with the sample source in the database.

# The second test (test_check_sample_source_associated_with_project_new_relationship) tests that the function creates a new relationship between the sample source and project(s) when there is no existing relationship
